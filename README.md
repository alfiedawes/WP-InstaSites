Installation Considerations
============================
• Apache mod_rewrite must be enabled.  Use command 'a2enmod rewrite' and then restart apache for this change to take effect.

• `.htaccess` file must contain the following:

```
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
```

• We recommend using "Day and Name" for permalink settings at first.  Other modes may require different rewrite rules in `.htaccess` (Wordpress Requirement.)
